This Capstone project was created as a part of the INSAID Capstone EDA projects.

## Introduction

Insaid Telecom, one of the leading telecom players, understands that customizing offering is very important for its business to stay competitive. Currently, InsaidTelecom is seeking to leverage behavioural data from more than 60% of the 50 million mobile devices active daily in India to help its clients better understand and interact with their audiences.

## Project Description

In this assignment, we have studied the demographics of a user (gender and age) based on their app download and usage behaviours. Data is collected from mobile apps that use InsaidTelecom services. Full recognition and consent from an individual user of those apps have been obtained, and appropriate anonymization has been performed to protect privacy. We have treated them as accurate ground truth for the sake of prediction. The data schema can be represented in the following table:
gender_age_train - Devices and their respective user gender, age and age_group.
phone_brand_device_model - Device ids, brand, and models phone_brand: few brands are in Chinese.

We have studied the InsaidTelecom user and device usage data for Maharashtra. Please check the notebook for code and observation below.
